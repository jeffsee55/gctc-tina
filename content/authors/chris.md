FAVORITE THING ABOUT SAN DIEGO?
The weather and the beach.

FAVORITE PLACE TO RUN IN SAN DIEGO?
Del Mar.

WHO INSPIRES YOU MOST?
My family. My wife and two sons inspire me to be better every day. Even when I don't want to run or I have a bad race, they are there to remind me to get after it and achieve my goals.

GOAL YOU ARE MOST EXCITED ABOUT?
2020 Olympic Final.

FAVORITE TRAINING DAY?
Monday. Monday runs always seem shorter after a long run the day before. Monday, for me, is all about recovering from the long run in time to have a good session on Tuesday.

FAVORITE THING ABOUT GCTC?
The people, even though I donâ€™t see the team all that much in a training environment, whenever we are together, I slot right in and feel part of the team instantly.

ACCOMPLISHMENT YOU ARE MOST PROUD OF?
NCAA Indoor Mile Champion.

TWO TRUTHS AND A LIE
I love pineapple on pizza.

I love big cities.

I love ironing.
