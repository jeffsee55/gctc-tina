FAVORITE THING ABOUT SAN DIEGO?
The perfect mix of cool urban vibes and laid-back beach culture.

FAVORITE PLACE TO RUN IN SAN DIEGO?
Lake Hodges (when we avoid running up the mountain)

WHO INSPIRES YOU MOST?
It’s lame to say my husband, but he's pretty solid. I’m also a big fan of mother pro runners. They seem magical.

GOAL YOU ARE MOST EXCITED ABOUT?
Tokyo 2020

FAVORITE TRAINING DAY?
Track day

FAVORITE THING ABOUT GCTC?
A training culture which is healthy and encouraging. Makes the hard training enjoyable and gives your work purpose.

ACCOMPLISHMENT YOU ARE MOST PROUD OF?
Consecutive 3 x national champ in the 1500m, and any time I've earned a spot on the Australian team

TWO TRUTHS AND A LIE
I wear exactly three rings on each hand
I have pierced my nose three different times
I didn't eat meat for almost three years
