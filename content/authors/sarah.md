FAVORITE THING ABOUT SAN DIEGO?
Sunshine and good vibes!

FAVORITE PLACE TO RUN IN SAN DIEGO?
Bonita to Sweetwater Reservoir

WHO INSPIRES YOU MOST?
Jen Rhines and current teammates. I tend to find the most inspiration from those around me on a daily basis. I’m thankful to have a great crew right here in San Diego.

GOAL YOU ARE MOST EXCITED ABOUT?
Placing top 3 at the Olympic Trials. And eventually running my first marathon!

Long run day. This definitely wasn’t the case a few years ago but have grown to love it over time.

FAVORITE THING ABOUT GCTC?
We have such a variety of different strengths that we can challenge each other in different ways.

ACCOMPLISHMENT YOU ARE MOST PROUD OF?
Qualifying for 2 World Cross Country Championships (Uganda 2017 and Denmark 2019)

TWO TRUTHS AND A LIE
I take a nap every day but wake up between 10-15 minutes later every single time.

I was the point guard for the basketball team all 4 years of high school.

I’ve raced on 5 different continents...2 more to go!
