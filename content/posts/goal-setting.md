Over the course of the 20 years that I was an elite runner I never had to deal with the specific challenges that have been thrown at us this year. However, I often decided to pursue some unorthodox goals; things that were exciting to me even if they didn’t fit the conventional “distance runner” plan. Following my passion and being open minded served me well over the years, and I think having a similar mindset can benefit many people right now!

What is it that I’m really excited to pursue? This is the first thing I ask myself when I sit down to plan my next big goal. Many times I have found that the answer is what I expect, but occasionally the answer was far different than what I originally thought. Sometimes we surprise ourselves when we let our minds drift outside of the norm. For example, you may typically run a spring marathon, but this time around you realize that it could be fun to try an ultra, or drop down in distance and run a series of the shorter races. If you’ve been running for a long time, you may tend to stay in the same routine, so take a moment to ask yourself if there’s something different that you’ve always wanted to do. Don’t put any limits on yourself in this part of the process.

When I was 35 I decided I wanted to sharpen my speed as much possible to help with my final kick at championship races, and also because it was simply fun to work a little harder in the weight room and pay even more attention to my running mechanics. I ran my best 200m and 800m times that season, and placed in the top 10 at the World Championships over the 5000m distance. While it’s unconventional to aim for personal bests in the shorter distances as you get older, this goal helped me compete better in tactical races and more importantly it kept things fresh and exciting. Doing something out of the ordinary can add some variety to your training, and it may open up more options for you to aim for during the pandemic.

Once I have something in mind that I’m really fired up about, I ask myself a series of questions to see if pursing this goal is realistic at the current time. I think passion should be the main driver in this process, but logic and practicality need to be applied before making a final decision. I may come across as a very logical and not overly emotional person, but I have always put passion and emotion first when planning which goals to chase!

While keeping these things in mind (passion and excitement), here are 3 questions to ask yourself to help determine if the goal you’re choosing is the right one.

###### 1. What is the time and energy commitment needed to accomplish this goal?

Think about how many hours per week you’ll need to train and consider if this fits with your current work and life demands. Also reflect on how much emotional energy the training will demand, and if you have that to give right now. If pursuing this goal is going to add stress to your life, then put it on the shelf for now. Make sure that this is a personal decision. Your friends and training partners may be tackling more or less than you in terms of training commitment, but keep in mind that everyone responds to training and life stresses differently. You want the process of pursuing this goal to add joy and happiness to your life, not diminish it!

###### 2. Are you intrinsically or extrinsically motivated?

Intrinsic motivation comes from within, meaning you’re motivated by the internal desire to do something for it’s own sake. You may see races simply as a test of your fitness; it’s you versus the clock. Whether you have competitors or you’re running a solo effort is irrelevant to you, all the motivation you need comes from within. If this sounds like you then focusing on virtual races may be a great fit. An additional benefit of racing virtually is that you get to choose the route, and many runners have been achieving personal bests this year by running fast courses that they’re familiar with.

Extrinsic motivation means that you’re motivated by an external factors, or the idea of earning an award. Sometimes this is seen in a negative light, but there’s nothing wrong with craving the the roar of the crowd at the Boston Marathon and receiving that coveted finishers medal as you cross the line alongside thousands of other runners! If these are the types of things that get you excited to get out the door and train it may best to pick a big event as your goal. If this isn’t possible in the current environment you will need to make it a long term goal and fill in the short term with smaller goals that are going to prepare you for the big one down the road. This may be time trials or virtual races, but it can also be things like focusing on improving your speed, your aerobic endurance, your strength in the gym, or your flexibility. Use this time to work on your weaknesses so that you’re ready to tackle the big event once you get the green light.

Another option for those of you that are social runners is to check out an app like Zwift. On Zwift you connect your treadmill or foot pod to the app, and you can run different routes alongside the other runners who are also logged on and even interact with each other. You can also find race opportunities on Zwift. It’s a great option for those of you who crave companionship when running inside on the treadmill.

###### 3. Will this goal provide you with the right amount of challenge?

If your goal is too easy you may find that it doesn’t provide enough stimulus to keep you excited and engaged in the process. This is an easy fix as you can always adjust your aim to something more difficult midway through the training plan. If your goal is exciting but maybe a little overwhelming and you don’t feel confident that you can accomplish it, consider breaking it into a series of achievable tasks. Set some attainable short term goals that will help you build towards the big one when the time is right.

Here’s an example from early on in my career. When I was a freshman in college I hit rock bottom in terms of my running, I was running well off my personal bests and I was finding it difficult to get back on track. Deep down I wanted to place in the top 3 at the NCAA XC Championships the following fall as a sophomore, but it seemed SO far away from where I was mentally, physically and emotionally in the middle of my freshman year. For the outdoor season I set goals of setting personal bests in the 3k and 5k, and scoring for the team at the conference championships. I achieved 2 out of 3 of these goals, and although I didn’t see them as huge accomplishments they helped me progress towards my future target. Seeing sustainable progress kept me motivated for more and helped build my confidence. I continued to work hard over the summer and the next year I placed 2nd at the NCAA XC Championships, helping our team win the NCAA title. There definitely wasn’t enough time my freshman year for me to make this big jump over 3 months, but by setting interim goals I was able to make it happen the next year. Small steps will often lead us to the big thing.

We are living in uncertain times but we can focus on the things that we can control, and choosing your next running goal falls into this category. Even when things are more predictable, taking the unconventional route can be a refreshing change, and having a target to work towards will keep you motivated to tackle your training. When so many things in our lives are changeable, following a training plan and tracking our progress can provide us with a sense of stability. Exercise is also good for our mood and our immune health, so once you have a game plan get out there and enjoy every bit of the process!
