preface: >-
  For the better part of the past 20 years I have spent a significant amount of
  the fall at my home away from home: Training Camp. First as an athlete and now
  a coach, I head to somewhere remote, often at a high altitude, and spend 4-6
  weeks in a place where time operates on an entirely different wavelength. This
  is the life of the professional endurance athlete, coaching staff and support
  crew

Mammoth Lakes, Flagstaff, Albuquerque, Font Romeu, Iten - they all possess the
same basic characteristics - lots of hills, lack of air and many more trees
than people. It's often what distance athletes need to return to the center.

Over the years these camps have afforded me plenty of time to observe and
understand why they <Isit /> matter so much to our athletes. I have found that
the camps themselves follow a movement, not dissimilar to that of a symphony.
They run through their phases and tempos - fast, slow, faster once again and
if done well, on to one hell of a crescendo. Each athlete contributes to the
chorus, testing limits high and low until the harmonics finally align and the
collective voices are now only one voice, one step, one breath.
